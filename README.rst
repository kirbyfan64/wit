A little low-level, Pascal/C-like language I'm working on.

NOT READY FOR GENERAL USE. LIKELY WILL NEVER BE. I'm just uploaded it here to 
be able to track my progress, as well as a cheap sort of "back-up" (I've run 
fowl ``dd`` and ``rm`` commands in the past...).

The language is written in `Crystal <http://crystal-lang.org>`_.

If you try to use this to actually write something and make it crash, it's not my
problem. Toy langauge != real language.
